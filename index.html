                In my free time I enjoy to read, and in the summertime I am outside a lot gardening and biking with
                friends.
                I also enjoy spending time with my dog and cat. I first got into programming in Grade 9, when I was
                accidentally placed into a beginner
                computer programming course instead of a business course. This turned out to be a good thing as it
                sparked my enjoyment of programming which
                led me to where I am now.
